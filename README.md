**📊 Customer Shopping Behavior Analysis**

**📌 Project Overview**
This project focuses on analyzing customer shopping behavior using transactional data from 3,900 purchases across multiple product categories.
The objective is to uncover insights into spending patterns, customer segmentation, product preferences, discount usage, and subscription behavior to support data-driven business decisions.

**🗂️ Dataset Summary**

Total Records: 3,900
Total Columns: 18


**Key Features:**

Customer Demographics: Age, Gender, Location, Subscription Status

Purchase Details: Item Purchased, Category, Purchase Amount, Season, Size, Color

Shopping Behavior:

Discount Applied

Previous Purchases

Frequency of Purchases

Review Rating

Shipping Type

**Data Quality:**
Missing Values: 37 missing entries in the Review Rating column
Missing ratings were handled during preprocessing.


🐍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using Python
The initial data preparation and analysis were performed using Python.
**Steps Involved:**

Data Loading: Imported dataset using pandas

Initial Exploration:

Used df.info() to inspect structure

Used df.describe() for summary statistics


**Missing Data Handli**ng:

Imputed missing Review Rating values using the median rating per product category

Column Standardization:

Converted column names to snake_case for readability

**Feature Engineering:**

Created age_group by binning customer ages

Created purchase_frequency_days from purchase history

**Data Consistency Check:**

Identified redundancy between discount_applied and promo_code_used

Dropped promo_code_used

**Database Integration:**

Loaded the cleaned dataset into PostgreSQL for SQL-based analysis

**🗄️ Data Analysis using SQL (PostgreSQL)**
Structured SQL queries were used to answer important business questions:

Revenue by Gender – Compared total revenue generated by male vs. female customers

High-Spending Discount Users – Customers using discounts but spending above average

Top 5 Products by Rating – Based on average review ratings

Shipping Type Comparison – Standard vs Express shipping impact on spending

Subscribers vs Non-Subscribers – Average spend and total revenue comparison

Discount-Dependent Products – Products with highest percentage of discounted purchases

Customer Segmentation – Classified customers as:

New

Returning

Loyal

Top 3 Products per Category – Most purchased products in each category

Repeat Buyers & Subscriptions – Subscription likelihood for customers with more than 5 purchases

Revenue by Age Group – Revenue contribution of each age group

**📈 Dashboard (Power BI)**
An interactive Power BI dashboard was created to visualize insights, including:

Revenue distribution

Customer segmentation

Product performance

Subscription impact

Discount usage trends

This dashboard enables stakeholders to quickly understand patterns and make informed decisions.

**💡 Business Recommendations**
